## What background knowledge is expected? {#background-knowledge}

- basic programming
- basic arithmetic, logic, gates
- development tools: VSCode and [git]({% link _resources/01-faq.md %}#git)

{% include slides/impact.html %}

## Lecture schedule


## What should you expect in lectures?

We'll have:

- slides
- live coding
- questions over chat

You should also read the [lecture]({% link _lectures/index.md
 %}) page.

## Labs

Labs are the most important part of the course!

[You are **expected** to attend all the lab sessions]({% link 01-policies.md %}#lab-attendance)

See the [lab page]({% link _labs/index.md %}) and [labs
FAQ]({% link _resources/01-faq.md %}#labs) for more details.

## Communication {#communication}

How do we communicate with each other in this course?
  - [the forum]({{site.forum_url}}): quickest and best place to get
    help
  - [the website]({% link index.md %}): lectures, labs, assessments, resources
  - your email: important individual messages

Make sure you check **all** regularly

It's all in the [communication policy]({% link 01-policies.md
%}#communication)

{% include slides/impact.html %}

don't email me policy: use the course forum, posts to teachers to ask questions - they **won't get lost**

## Assessment

(See the assessment page on the website!)

## Resources

There's no set text for this course, all the material will be provided on or
linked from the course website.

You should look at the [books & links page]({% link
_resources/04-books-links.md %})

## Academic integrity

- read the [course policy]({% link 01-policies.md %}#academic-integrity)
- assignments are _strictly individual_
- there's lots of great text & code out there on the web (which is great!)
- if you find some code you want to use, **you must clearly indicate which bits
  of code aren't yours, where you got them, and what licence you're using them
  under**
- do NOT submit code that **isn't yours** without clearly indicating the above.
- do NOT expect marks for code you didn't write.
- read the [FAQ]({% link _resources/01-faq.md
  %}#academic-misconduct)

## What I expect from you

I expect that you:

- regularly read the course website & check forum/email
- engage with the course material *early*
- attend your labs & get to know your tutor 
- act with **integrity**

## What you can expect from me

If you do this, I promise to:

- give you help when you ask *ahead of time*
- provide a clear, well organised course website with all the information you
  need (so make sure you read it!)
- **care about you** & support you in your learning journey *wherever you're at*

{:.fragment}
But if you don't engage, then I can't support you. You've been warned!

assessment timeline?

lecture slides?

lab content?

late submission/extension/academic misconduct policies?

## Programming languages

This course mainly uses ARMv7 assembly language.

You'll do a _little_ bit of C (one step above assembly!)

It's useful to illustrate how this assembly code relates to
other languages, and we'll use lots of different examples in the slides.

{% include slides/talk.html %}

Introduce yourself in the chat! Say hello, and answer one of these questions:

- one weird food that most people hate but you enjoy
- one boring fact about yourself

Here are a couple of questions you can ask one another:

- what are you most looking forward to about this course?
- what are you most anxious about?
- what's your plan for making the most of this course?
