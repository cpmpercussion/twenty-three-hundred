# How to get a micro:bit

You **can't complete this course** without a physical [micro:bit v2](https://microbit.org/new-microbit/) (we call it a microbit for short!); you will need it for every lab and assignment. 

### On campus

**If you are on ANU campus**, we will give you a microbit and a USB cable in week 1 labs.

You don't have to do anything. (hooray!) 

### Off campus

**If you are not on ANU campus**, it is your responsibility to [obtain a microbit](https://microbit.org/buy/) so that you can complete this course. It's **required equipment**.

The [buy page on the micro:bit website](https://microbit.org/buy/) provides
plenty of options for obtaining micro:bit v2's.

Make sure you buy the correct micro:bit, i.e.: a "BBC micro:bit v2". You can
tell it's a "v2" because it has "v2" written on the back of the circuit board,
and because it has a speaker (big square part on the back).

Microbits are available by themself (board in a little box) in which case you need a USB cable (see below), or in a boxed "Go" kit with batteries and USB cable included. The battery part isn't necessary for the course.

You will also need a USB A to USB Micro-B cable (see picture below) to connect the microbit to your
computer. Any generic USB-A to USB Micro-B cable will work fine, and you are
likely to have one of these in a drawer around the house somewhere or can
easily obtain one from EBay, Amazon, Tao Bao, etc. 


Make sure you get the kind that looks like this:

## FAQ

### I _am_ coming to Canberra, do I need to buy a microbit?

No, we will provide one to you in your week 1 lab. If you arrive later than
week 1 you can pick it up when you arrive.

### I _am not_ going to be in Canberra, do I need to buy a microbit?

Yes, it's required equipment for this course.

### Can you please send me a microbit?

No, unfortunately we can't do that. You can buy one from many online retailers
around the world.

### Do I need a microbit in week 1?

It's good to have your microbit as soon as possible, but it isn't _required_
until week 4. In weeks 1, 2, and 3 you are able to use our emulator to complete
the lab tasks.
