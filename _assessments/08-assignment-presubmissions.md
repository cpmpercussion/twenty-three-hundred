This assessment task requires you to begin planning your assignment and to
prepare a brief design proposal indicating what you plan to build and how you
will do it.

The assessment will be conducted in lab and will be worth 1 mark for each assignment.

You will need to fork and clone the assignment template repository and fill in
a design proposal (200 words or fewer) that outlines what your planned design
is and how you will accomplish it.

## Outline

- **Submission Dates**:
  - Assignment 1 Pre-submission: Due by the start of your week 5 lab.
  - Assignment 2 Pre-submission:  Due by the start of your week 9 lab.
- **Weight**: 1 mark per assignment (total of 2% of your final mark).
- **Length**: 200 words or fewer
- **Submission**: GitLab

## Process:

{:.warn-box}
Read this process carefully. If you show up to your lab without completing the process below up to step 4, you will get zero.

Completing your Pre-Submission:

1. Carefully read the assignment specification and understand what you are
   being asked to do.

2. Fork and clone the assignment template.

3. Think of an idea for what you might like to do for your assignment, write it
   down in the file `design-proposal.md` which is contained in your assignment
   repo. You need to explain **"what" you want to build and (roughly), "how"
   you will accomplish it** in ARM-v7 assembly on the micro:bit. The word limit
   is 200 words.

4. Commit and push your edited `design-proposal.md` file.

5. Read the assignment specification again and think: Does my proposal meet the
   specification? Am I building what is expected for this assignment? Is there
   scope to extend my proposal? If the answer to these questions is "no" then
   go back to step 2.

Getting your feedback and applying it:

6. Attend your lab and have a discussion with your tutor about your design
   proposal. Listen to their feedback (you might want to take notes). You'll
   receive a mark on Streams at the start of the next week.

7. Think about your feedback; you will likely want to adjust your assignment
   idea to better match the specification or otherwise take on board
   suggestions from your tutor.

8. Start coding your assignment and writing your design document!

| 0.5  | Has forked/cloned assignment template. Design proposal includes a satisfactory effort to describe a design. The sophistication of the described design is at an acceptable/good standard. |
| 0.25 | Has forked/cloned assignment template. Design proposal includes a minimal effort to describe a design. The sophistication of the described design is below our acceptable standard.       |
| 0    | Has not forked/cloned assignment template or has forked/cloned but there is minimal to describe a potential assignment solution.                                                          |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why are we doing this? I just wanna code. {#why}

The assignments in this course ask you to build  creative and expressive
programs for your micro:bit. You will need to come up with an idea that meets
the assignment specification and is also possible given your (rapidly
expanding) knowledge of ARM-v7 assembly language and the micro:bit itself.

Defining an idea is **hard** so this assessment task focusses just on the early
design stage for your assignments. This serves two purposes:

1. It helps you by getting you to define your idea before you even start coding
   and giving you a guaranteed way to get feedback.

2. It acknowledges that articulation work (writing down an idea) is actually
   work and can be part of your final mark for the class.

The feedback you get from your tutor here is likely to be the **most
important** feedback you get in the course. The tutors will be able to point
out improvements to almost everybody's idea. Everybody will benefit from an
early second opinion on their design proposal and will likely create better
assignments.

It is very likely that the tutors will also talk to a few students where the
idea is unlikely to result in a good assignment. It might be way too hard or
maybe it will not actually meet the assignment specification. If this is you
then you are getting amazing value from this assessment. You just saved
yourself a lot of frustration from working hard in the wrong direction.

### I don't want to do this. Do we have to? {#do-i-have-to}

No, you don't **have** to do anything. But you won't get a mark for this
assessment item unless you do it.

### Can I submit my design proposal in a different way? {#different-way}

No, you must follow the process above.

### Will I get my mark in the lab?

No, your mark will be released at the start of the week after your pre-submission lab.
