As this course is an online resource only, there are no policies apart from a general code of conduct for interactions relating to this material.

## Code of conduct {#code-of-conduct}

Everyone in this course is responsible for:

- Promoting an inclusive, collaborative learning environment.
- Taking action when others do not.

**We reject behaviour that strays into harassment, no matter how mild.**
Harassment refers to offensive verbal or written comments in reference to
gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion;
sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography  or recording, sustained disruption of class meetings,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If you feel someone is violating these principles (for example, with a joke
that could be interpreted as sexist, racist, or exclusionary), **it is your
responsibility to speak up!** If the behaviour persists, send a private message
to your course convener to explain the situation. We will preserve your
anonymity[^1].

Note that you are also bound by the [ANU Student Code of
Conduct](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/program-management/student-code-of-conduct)
during your time as an ANU student, in particular students are expected to:

> actively participate in learning activities including all class time,
> independent learning and assessments, and strive to seek depth, breadth and
> challenge in their learning;

[^1]: This code of conduct was adapted from the COMP1110 Code of Conduct, and originally developed by Evan Peck of Bucknell University. Portions of this code of conduct are adapted from Dr. Lorena A. Barba
