Hi there I'm Charles Martin and I'm the

3
00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.480
lecturer for COMP2300/6300 Computer

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.960
Organization and Program Execution here

5
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.120
at the ANU. This course is about learning

6
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.360
how your computer actually works,

7
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.559
we'll look at the different parts of a

8
00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.119
CPU, how they fit together, and how the

9
00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.800
high level programs that you might write

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.480
in other courses get turned into

11
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.480
instructions that the CPU can actually

12
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.800
execute. I just want to welcome everyone

13
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.640
to this course whether you're here on

14
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.720
ANU campus or whether you can't be with

15
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.519
us this semester, you're all very welcome.

16
00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.480
Most of the content for COMP2300/6300

17
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.640
is already online on our website and you

18
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.719
can check it out. Now one of the really

19
00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.320
exciting things about this course is

20
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.559
that everyone will get one of these

21
00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.239
this is a microbit and it's a tiny

22
00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.079
computer which fits in your pocket. It's

23
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.760
got a little CPU which you can use in

24
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.440
your labs and assignments to understand

25
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.920
how the CPU in your laptop or desktop

26
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.920
computer actually works.

27
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.000
A lot of this course looks like this

28
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.079
you'll be writing programs in assembly

29
00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.199
that means you'll be directly

30
00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.120
controlling what the CPU on your microbit

31
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.800
is doing. We'll be looking at how

32
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.360
high-level programming concepts from C

33
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.600
Java or Python might get transformed

34
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.040
into assembly instructions that your

35
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.720
computer can run. You'll learn some

36
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.560
fundamentals about operating systems and

37
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.400
networks and how they relate to your

38
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.560
computer's hardware. Finally a theme of

39
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.560
this course is that the assignments are

40
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.320
about making expressive and creative

41
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.320
programs for your microbit the

42
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.960
microbit has buttons, it has LED lights, it has

43
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.759
a speaker, and you can use it to create a

44
00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.840
sound and light show or an interactive

45
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.000
toy. This course is a lot of fun and I

46
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.680
think you're really going to enjoy it.

47
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.570
See you in week one!
