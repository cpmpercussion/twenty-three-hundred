Welcome to Twenty-Three Hundred, a creative introductory course in computer systems!

This is the course where you learn how your computer **actually works**: you'll learn how a CPU is constructed, how the parts of your computer work together, and how the high-level programming languages that you have learned in other courses can be translated into assembly language and CPU instructions.

You'll learn by writing programs for your very own **micro:bit**, a tiny computer that fits in your pocket. In the labs and assessments you'll experiment with your micro:bit to learn about how the CPU in your laptop or desktop computers work, and create expressive programs that interact with the real world through the micro:bits sensors and it's light and sound outputs.

Twenty-Three Hundred is a course that **challenges your assumptions** about how computers work, and what happens in our computer when we run a program, and our focus on **expressive and creative assessment** tasks could make this an exciting turning point in your computer science journey.

## Acknowledgements

These learning materials were taught by Charles Martin from 2019--2022 at the Australian National University from materials adapted from [Ben Swift](https://benswift.me) and [Uwe Zimmer](http://transit-port.net). Apologies Uwe for presenting some of your amazing diagrams in a weird format! 

Many tutors and staff contributed text and ideas to the learning activities and assessments along the way including Brent Schuetze, Harrison Shoebridge, Benjamin Gray, Ashleigh Johannes, and others I have forgotten to mention. Teaching this course was an incredible journey (and a lot of work) and I thank the students who sent a lot of positive energy and ideas back.
